    <p>Join us for a night of melted cheese and good company.</p>
    The city bustles with energy and light,
    But in this cozy apartment, all is right.
    Friends gather round the table with glee,
    For a raclette party in New York City.

    The cheese is melted and bubbling hot,
    Paired with potatoes, it's the perfect pot.
    We add some charcuterie and a glass of wine,
    As laughter and conversation intertwine.

    The streets outside may be cold and gray,
    But in this warm room, it's a happy day.
    We take a break from the hustle and bustle,
    To enjoy this Swiss tradition, oh so rustic.

    As the night wears on and the cheese is gone,
    We raise our glasses, and sing a song.
    To friendship, to good food, and to this city,
    We'll always remember this raclette party.
